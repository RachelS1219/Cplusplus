Summarize the project and what it was solving:
This program allows a user to see how different investments accrue over time. It allows the user to set the initial deposit amount, an interest rate, additional monthly deposit amounts, and how many years theyd like to see. 
The program prints out 2 tables, one with monthly deposits and one without, showing each years starting and ending amounts as well as the amount of interest accrued that particular year.

What did you do particularly well?
I enjoyed seperating the functions into their own header file. I think that really cleared up my code in main and made it easy to understand how the program works.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
After learning about memory leaks I would be curious to go through the program and see if I have any. I had no clue they existed when I originally wrote this program so I'm sure there's something somewhere.

Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I find that formatting the file to print in a particular fashion to make it 'presentable' or to look like a table is really tedious. I do wonder if there is some sort of built in formatting class I could import to make that easier in the future (or just create my own I suppose?). I spent a lot of time researching things like 'right, left, fixed, setw', etc to make everything look nice.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projets or course work?
I think I really began to grasp the concept of having multiple files in a project to keep things organized. I appreciated how clean it kept my main file. I do wish I had a better grasp on classes, so I look forward to developing something with more class files in the future.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I hate to reiterate the same thing here, but I really liked seperating the files. It almost feels like cleaning up a workspace to me. I think for editing the file in the future it also makes it really easy to find particular functions.
I also made sure to leave in line comments describing either my thought process for the function or how the function works with main so someone who didn't write the code would have an easy time understanding how it worked.
